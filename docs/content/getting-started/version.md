RestQA is on constant improvement, we are happy to share more and more feature.
However from a consumer perspective, this can be difficult to keep track on the latest version.

In order to stay up to date, run the command: 

```
npm i -g @restqa/restqa@latest
```

This command will install the latest version of RestQA on computer

Take a look at the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/restqa/restqa/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) to track the changes.
