# Test your microservice locally

RestQA enhances developer experience by making microservice local testing easier.

Finally an easy way to test microservices locally. While most of the testing framework are focusing on the meaningless test of function or classes.
RestQA target the testing at the input/output level, regardless of the technology, framework, version, etc..
RestQA aim to focus on testing the actual business responsibility of your service.

Only one command to run:

```bash
restqa run
```
