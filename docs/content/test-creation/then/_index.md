Once your API has been triggered, you can now checking if the API response has the expected information.

Ghekin is using the keyword **Then** in order to validate the expected assertion.

RestQA comes will a multiple pre-defined **Then** Step definition, allowing you to describe your API Response assertion just in a few seconds.

### Example:


Here an API Response:

```http
Response status code: 200
Response headers: content-Type :application/json; charset=utf-8
Response body:
{
    "foo": "bar"
}
```

In order to translate it using the RestQA Gherkin **Then** statement, we would have:

```gherkin
Then status = 200
Then header "Content-Type" = "application/json; charset=utf-8"
Then "foo" = "bar"
```

or using the **And** statement (recommended):

```gherkin
Then status = 200
  And header "Content-Type" = "application/json; charset=utf-8"
  And "foo" = "bar"
```

> As you can see the keyword **And** allows you to chain multiple **Then** Statement.
