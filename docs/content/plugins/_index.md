## Introduction

The RestQA promise is to be able to fit to your project, however this a huge challenge. Each user have different needs.
By tackling this challenge we decided to build RestQA on Plugin system.
This plugin system enables the modularity required in order to extend the initial capababilities of RestQA.

A plugin will import built-in step definition. For your information all the step definition added by default into RestQA are coming from the plugin [RestQapi](https://github.com/restqa/restqapi)

Since RestQA aims to be a community driven tool, we can imagine that at some point we will have plugins available to cover the needs of everyone.

## Official plugins

### Install
 
Plugin are based on NodeJs, then it means they should be availabe on a package directory (usually Npm).
As any npm package you will need to install into your project directory such as:

```bash
npm install @restqa/faker-plugin
```

or

```bash
yarn add @restqa/faker-plugin
```

Once the module is installed you have to edit your `.restqa.yml` in order to enable the plugin into your project.
Example:

```yaml title=".restqa.yml" {13-16}
version: 0.0.1
metadata:
  code: EXAMPLE
  name: Example app
  description: This is the example app description
test:
  local:
    port: 8887
    command: npm run dev
plugins:
  - name: @restqa/faker-plugin
   config:
     locale: 'fr' # default en
     prefix: 'faker' # the prefix used for the place holders
```

As you can see under the section plugin we added the lines:

```yaml
- name: @restqa/faker-plugin
  config:
    locale: 'en' 
    prefix: 'faker'
```

It means from now, you can use all the built-in step definition from the `@restqa/faker-plugin` into your feature files.

> When you are installing plugin do not forget to save the plugin into the `package.json` and update your continuous integration tool to add the step `npm install` before running your tests.

### Finding plugins

You will be able to find the all the official RestQA plugin within this documentation under the section [Step Definition](../tests/introduction)

However to access to a larger list of plugin mostly created by the community, you should take a look at the [restqa plugin available on npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:restqa-plugin)

## Create your own plugin

RestQA exposes a package to create your own plugins. Let's [give a try](getting-started).
