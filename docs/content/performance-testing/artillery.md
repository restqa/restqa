[Artillery](https://artillery.io) is an amazing Load testing tool with an GREAT Developer Experience.


RestQA is not running performance test. However RestQA is generating Artillery test scenario based on your functional tests


## Pre-requisite

 * 1 minute  ðŸš€
 * [Artillery](https://artillery.io) installed
 * Valid RestQA configuration file
 * Valid Test scenario

## Configuration 

```yaml {13-14} title=".restqa.yml"
version: 0.0.1
metadata:
  code: EXAMPLE
  name: Example app
  description: This is the example app description
tests:
  unit:
    port: 8887
    command: npm run dev
  performance:
    tool: artillery
```

### Options

Additional options are availble, check the [performance testing](#/documentation/performance-testing) page

## Scenario

In order to select a scenario to be run through Artillery, just add the tag `@performance` on top of it:

Example: 
```gherkin title="tests/integration/get-product.feature" {1-1}
@performance
Scenario Outline: The product doesn't exist into the database
Given I have the api gateway
  And I have the path "/api/products/111112222233333"
  And I have the method "GET"
  And the header contains "accept-language" as "<language>"
  And the header contains "content-type" as "application/json"
When I run the API
Then I should receive a response with the status 404
  And the response body at "message" should equal "<message>"
  And the response time is under 1000 ms
Examples:
| language | message                    |
| en       | The product doesn't exist. |
| fr       | Le produit n'existe pas.   |
| it       | Le produit n'existe pas.   |
| default  | Le produit n'existe pas.   |

```

## Generate the load test scenario:

The Artillery scenario will be generated every time you run the RestQA tests:

```
restqa run --report
```

## Run your performance tests

RestQA will only generate the Artillery Scenario, **it will not create the Artillery configuration for you**, we are recommending that you store the configuration into a file.

Example:
```yaml title="tests/performance/config.yml"
config:
  target: "https://example.com"
  phases:
    - duration: 10
      arrivalRate: 1
```

Then run your artillery command:

```
artillery -c tests/performance/config.yml tests/performance/
```

And Voila!

Now it's opening the door to get your start performance testing step into your continuous integration flow withing a few minutes.
