  <h2>How Many Microservices depend on this Microservice?</h2>

  The microservice architecture brings a complexity that we tend to forget:
  Mocks management.
  <br />
  <br />
  RestQA would like to support you on that annoying task.<br />
  What if you could simply get up to date mock of the current microservice that you can use directly while you are testing another microservice?
  <br />
  <br />
  This is exactly what RestQA did for you!
  <br />
  <br />
  See below the list of mocks that has been generated in the folder 
  <i>{{ mocks.data.outputFolder }}</i
  >:
  <ul>
    <li v-for="(item, index) in mocks.data.files" :key="index">
      <el-link href="{{ item }}" target="_blank">{{
        item.replace(mocks.data.outputFolder, "")
      }}</el-link>
    </li>
  </ul>
