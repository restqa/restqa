[RestQA](https://restqa.io) was born from a need of getting more transparency of a product behavior. It consists of two major parts:

- Use Gherkin to enforce the ATDD (acceptance test driven development) as pratice across the team member regardless of their background

- Reuse the team toolset as maximum, in order to reduce the learning curve and focus on the product behavior test scenario

In addition, RestQA is highly extensible via its [Plugin API](https://docs.restqa.io/api/plugin-api) and [Output API](https://docs.restqa.io/api/output-api).
