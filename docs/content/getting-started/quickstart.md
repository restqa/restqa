### Pre requisite

In order to run you will to have :

* NodeJs installed
* Npm or Yarn installed

## Install with npm

To install RestQA globally run the command:

```bash
npm install @restqa/restqa -g
```

## Initialize your first project

In order to initialize your first project run the command:

```bash
restqa init -y
```

The `-y` option will create the project using the default values.


![restqa init](../assets/restqa-init.gif)

And Voila! Your first test has been setup using the RestQA demo environment.

A typical RestQA project will have the following source file structure:

```
- .restqa.yml            # RestQA configuration file
- test/
  - integrations/
    - welcome.feature    # Sample test scenario
```

You can look at your folder and you will see the RestQA configuration file `.restqa.yml`.

```yaml title=".restqa.yml"
version: 0.0.1
metadata:
  code: APP
  name: app
  description: Configuration generated by restqa init
environments:
  - name: local
    default: true
    plugins:
      - name: restqapi
        config:
          url: https://api.restqa.io
    outputs:
      - type: html
        enabled: true
      - type: file
        enabled: true
        config:
          path: restqa-result.json
```

And your first sample test scenario was created on the file: `./tests/integration/welcome-restqa.feature`

```gherkin title="./tests/integration/welcome-restqa.feature"
Feature: Welcome to the RestQA community

Scenario: Get the list of useful RestQA resources
Given I have the api gateway hosted on "https://restqa.io"
  And I have the path "/welcome.json"
  And I have the method "GET"
When I run the API
Then I should receive a response with the status 200
  And the response body should be equal to:

## Run the Sample test scenario.

From now you can run the test scenario using the command

```bash
restqa run
```

And Voila your first test scenario has been executed and passed!

You can see the result into the `./report` folder.

## Access to the RestQA Dashboard
