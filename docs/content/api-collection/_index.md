### The challenge of API collection

While developing Microservice the API collection plays a major role when it comes to run manual or integration testing.
However the developer experience around it is terrible.
How do you feel when you have to contribute to a new microservice and you have no clue on how to perform request, you will try to grab a collection form a previous developer...
But what if you can't? 

This is where RestQA will help you! No more challenge on maintening your API collection, now its automatically up to date!
Someone added a new endpoint a few month back! No problem download the latest API collection and we can continue the developments.


### Key benefits

#### Up to date

Every new update to your microservice, every new scenario added will be reflected in your API collection.

#### Single source of truth

Stop sharing unorganized API collection from a team member to another... Just ask to the main source of truth: ResgtQA ü¶è!

#### Organized

Finally you don't need to spend more time on organizing your API collection anymore, when it's started to get messy just overrid the mess with the latest organized version!

#### Versioned

You are not sure about what is happening, why a new parameter has a weird behavior? Just use GIT to go back on history and generate a new collection üòÄ.

#### Craftmanship Friendly

Finish your local test, then download the latest collection and test manually in a second.

#### Tooling

Since each developper has their own tool preference to manage API collection, RestQA generates API collection compatible with all the popular tools out there.
