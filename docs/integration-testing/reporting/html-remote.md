Setting the **Remote HTML** test report is very simple.

### What is remote html report ?

The remote html report is a report that will be hosted on a remote server.

### Why ?

The main reason is to enable an easy integration with some CI tools.
As you may use some tools like Github Action, Gitlab CI, and etc... are not allowing a simple viusalization of the test report.
Then RestQA is providing a way to send the result and access to it through a remote url.


## Pre-requisite

 * 1 minute  ðŸš€
 * Valid RestQA configuration file
 * A deploy RestQA dashboard (if you want to self host your html reports)

## Configuration 

```yaml
tests:
  integrations:
  - name: sandbox
    outputs:
      - type: 'html-remote'
        enabled: true
        config: 
          url: 'https://restqa.my-company.com/reports'
```
