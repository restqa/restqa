Test creation are based on the Agnostic Language: Gherkin.
The key benefit of using Gherkin is that you will be able to re-use your test regardless the implementation language of your microservices.

In order to undertand better the best way to write scenario, you should first be comfortable with cucumber, take a look at the [cucumber documentation](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/) to fully understand the diifferent definition on the current page.
