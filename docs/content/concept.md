RestQA bring a new dimension to microservice testing, the last few years when we moved from Monolith to Microservice, we increase the modularity but... We also decrease the quality of the service delivered.

This why we want to introduce the Test Driven Happiness!

## ğŸ˜ƒ Why Test Driven Happiness?

Within our DEV team while working with microservice, we realized a few thing:

- ğŸ˜¡ **WE HATE** Writting Local Test
- ğŸ˜¡ **WE HATE** Reviewing long unreadable Local Test
- ğŸ˜¡ **WE HATE** Maintaining the Integration Test
- ğŸ˜¡ **WE HATE** Maintaining the Performance Test
- ğŸ˜¡ **WE HATE** Maintaining the API specification
- ğŸ˜¡ **WE HATE** Maintaining the postman collection
- ğŸ˜¡ **WE HATE** Maintaining the HTTP Mocks
- ğŸ˜¡ **WE HATE** Rewrite the test while changing the microservice technology

This is why we decided to challenge ourself on how to transform this anger into a positive initative.
RestQA was build with a simple goal Driving the happiness of the DEV team through testing.
