## 😃 Why Test Driven Happiness?

Within our DEV team while working with microservice, we realized a few thing:

- [X] **WE HATE** Writting Local Test
- [X] **WE HATE** Reviewing long unreadable Local Test full of mocks
- [X] **WE HATE** Maintaining the Integration Test
- [X] **WE HATE** Maintaining the Performance Test
- [X] **WE HATE** Maintaining the API specification
- [X] **WE HATE** Maintaining the postman collection
- [X] **WE HATE** Maintaining the HTTP Mocks
- [X] **WE HATE** Rewrite the test while changing the microservice technology

This is why we decided to challenge ourself on how to transform this anger into a positive initative.
RestQA was build with a simple goal: Driving the happiness of the DEV team through testing.

Run one command and get everything that you need to enjoy maintaining your microservice.

## 🎬 Demo

## 📦 Install

Once you get nodeJs on your local machine run the command

```
npm install -D @restqa/restqa
```

```
yarn add @restqa/restqa -D
```

## 🎯 Usage

In you `package.json` add the script:

```
  "scripts": {
    "test": "restqa run",
    "happy": "restqa run --report"
  }

```

Run the command:

```
npm test
```

It will automatically initialize RestQA into your project and generate the initial test for you ^^

Then you can Write your Unit Test Using ordinary language:

```gherkin
Feature: GET /api/infos

Scenario: Get the list of informations
Given a request
When GET "/api/info"
Then status = 200
  And body:
  """
{
  "message": "Hello World!"
}
  """
```

Then simply run the command to get full report:

```
npm run happy
```

## 🌈 Example

Take a look at the [examples folder](./examples) to see a basic setup.
